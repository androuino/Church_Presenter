# Church Presenter App
Church Presenter v2.0
This app still in development and you may experience unexpected behavior. In that case, please create an issue.

I also apologize for lacking of documentation on how to use this app as I am very busy with my sched.

The purpose why I created this app is because my original plan is to run this in Raspberry pi and control it remotely as long as both devices (Rpi and a computer) are connected to the same network.
If you don't have a raspberry pi, you can still use this app using your normal computer.

## The download links

## To use in Windows
